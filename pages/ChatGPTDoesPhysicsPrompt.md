# ChatGPT Does Physics Prompt

For each of the responses I put the prompt below into ChatGPT. I have copied the first response that is formatted correctly for each LO. I used GPT-4o for all of the responses.

## Prompt:

I am a professor teaching an introductory physics course for non-majors. I would like a practice problem to help test my students' understanding of one of our learning outcomes. The learning outcome is: 
Learning Outcome

Please write a problem that will assess their understanding of this learning outcome. Give your response a bold title with a name for the problem. The problem should have 2 or 3 parts and be suitable for an undergraduate student in an algebra based class. After the problem, write a solution to the problem. The solution should walk through your work step by step in a bulleted list. After the bulleted list, write a complete sentence stating the answer. Use plain text instead of LaTeX to format your response.

## Learning Outcomes:

-Outcome 1: Describe how energy is transformed and transferred in the human body. This includes using the work-energy equation from Chapter 10.

-Outcome 2: Set up and solve problems involving heat engines or heat pumps and make quantitative statements about these situations.

-Outcome 3: Set up and solve problems for systems with changes in temperature and/or phase.

-Outcome 4: Qualitatively and quantitatively describe how objects transfer heat to other objects or to their environment through conduction, convection, radiation, and evaporation.

-Outcome 5: Set up and solve problems involving gas processes. This includes using pV diagrams, the ideal gas law, and the first law of thermodynamics.

-Outcome 6: Use Bernoulli’s equation to solve problems for incompressible fluids in pipes that change height and shape/size.

-Outcome 7: Use Archimedes' principle to determine and discuss objects submerged or partially submerged in a fluid.

-Outcome 8: Convert between graphical representations of simple harmonic motion and physical quantities (frequency, angular frequency, period, amplitude) describing the motion.

-Outcome 9: Use the principles of mechanics to set up and solve problems involving springs. This includes forces and energy. 

-Outcome 10: Qualitatively and quantitatively compare and contrast both transverse and longitudinal waves, particularly waves on a string and sound waves.

-Outcome 11: Apply energy and power concepts to waves, including use of the sound intensity level.

-Outcome 12: Calculate and describe wave characteristics for standing waves, in particular standing waves on a string and in a tube. These characteristics include wavelength, frequency, wave mode, beats, fundamental frequency, and harmonics.

-Outcome 13: Set up and solve problems involving single slit diffraction, double slit diffraction, and diffraction gratings.

-Outcome 14: Set up and solve thin-film interference problems. Be able to qualitatively describe when constructive and destructive interference occur.

-Outcome 15: Use Snell’s law of refraction to describe light as it goes from one material to another material, including the condition for total internal reflection.

-Outcome 16: Use ray diagrams to qualitatively locate and describe images formed by lenses and mirrors.

-Outcome 17: Use the thin-lens equation to quantitatively locate and describe images formed by lenses and mirrors.
